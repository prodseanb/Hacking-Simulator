# Hacking-Simulator
A mini hacking simulator game using the cmd module. 
Goal: Hack into 4 user accounts, delete a document. 
To access a user account, you will find a password stored somewhere in a text file. 
You will also need a username, also stored in a text file. The password consists of random strings,
although, it also contains a series of clues within the strings. To advance to the next level/user, you will find a
text file containing the next password required to access the next user.
